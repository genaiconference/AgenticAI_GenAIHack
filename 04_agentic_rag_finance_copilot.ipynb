A contract is considered a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration (IFRS 16, paragraph 9).\n\n- **Right to Control**: To determine if a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the entity must assess whether, throughout the period of use, the customer has both:\n  - The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset (paragraphs B21-B23).\n  - The right to direct the use of the identified asset (paragraphs B24-B30) (IFRS 16, paragraph B9).\n\n- **Identified Asset**: An asset is typically identified by being explicitly specified in a contract. However, it can also be identified implicitly at the time the asset is made available for use by the customer (IFRS 16, paragraph B13).\n\n- **Reassessment**: An entity must reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease only if the terms and conditions of the contract are changed (IFRS 16, paragraph 11).\n\n- **Separating Components**: For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, an entity must account for each lease component within the contract separately from non-lease components, unless the practical expedient in paragraph 15 is applied (IFRS 16, paragraph 12).\n\n- **Flowchart for Assessment**: A flowchart is provided in IFRS 16 to assist entities in making the assessment of whether a contract is, or contains, a lease (IFRS 16, paragraph B31).\n\nThese steps ensure that entities correctly identify and account for leases in accordance with IFRS 16. \n\n</font>"

A contract is considered a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration (IFRS 16, paragraph 9).\n\n- **Right to Control**: To determine if a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the entity must assess whether, throughout the period of use, the customer has both:\n  - The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset (paragraphs B21-B23).\n  - The right to direct the use of the identified asset (paragraphs B24-B30) (IFRS 16, paragraph B9).\n\n- **Identified Asset**: An asset is typically identified by being explicitly specified in a contract. However, it can also be identified implicitly at the time the asset is made available for use by the customer (IFRS 16, paragraph B13).\n\n- **Reassessment**: An entity must reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease only if the terms and conditions of the contract are changed (IFRS 16, paragraph 11).\n\n- **Separating Components**: For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, an entity must account for each lease component within the contract separately from non-lease components, unless the practical expedient in paragraph 15 is applied (IFRS 16, paragraph 12).\n\n- **Flowchart for Assessment**: A flowchart is provided in IFRS 16 to assist entities in making the assessment of whether a contract is, or contains, a lease (IFRS 16, paragraph B31).\n\nThese steps ensure that entities correctly identify and account for leases in accordance with IFRS 16. \n\n</font>"
