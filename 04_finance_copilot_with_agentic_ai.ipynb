       "\n",
       "1. **Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets**:\n",
       "   - Recognize a deferred tax asset for unused tax losses and credits if it is probable that future taxable profit will be available (IAS 12, paragraph 34).\n",
       "   - For entities with recent losses, recognize deferred tax assets only if there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or convincing evidence of future taxable profit (IAS 12, paragraph 35).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Assessment of Probability**:\n",
       "   - Consider sufficient taxable temporary differences, probability of future taxable profits, identifiable non-recurring causes of losses, and tax planning opportunities (IAS 12, paragraph 36).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Tax Loss Carryback**:\n",
       "   - Recognize the benefit of a tax loss that can be carried back to recover current tax of a previous period as an asset (IAS 12, paragraph 13).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Measurement and Recognition**:\n",
       "   - Recognize the benefit as an asset in the period the tax loss occurs if it is probable that the benefit will flow to the entity and can be reliably measured (IAS 12, paragraph 14).\n",

IAS 12.37 requires that the carrying amount of deferred tax assets should be reviewed at the end of each reporting period. If it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilized, the carrying amount should be reduced accordingly.\\n   - Conversely, if it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available, the previously unrecognized deferred tax asset should be recognized.\\n\\n4. **Disclosure Requirements**:\\n   - IAS 12.81(g) mandates the disclosure of the amount and expiry date, if any, of deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognized in the statement of financial position.\\n   - Additionally, IAS 12.82 requires the disclosure of the nature of the evidence supporting the recognition of deferred tax assets when the utilization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable profits exceeding the profits arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences.\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n- IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\" paragraphs 34, 37, 47, 81(g), and 82.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that tax losses are accounted for accurately and in compliance with IFRS standards.', 'metadata': []}, 'unified_response': {'answer': 'To account for tax losses under IAS 12 \"Income Taxes,\" consider the following key points:\\n\\n1. **Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets**:\\n   - A deferred tax asset should be recognized for the carryforward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized (IAS 12, paragraph 34).\\n   - When an entity has a history of recent losses, it recognizes a deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses or tax credits only to the extent that the entity has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available (IAS 12, paragraph 35).\\n\\n2. **Assessment of Probability**:\\n   - The entity should consider sufficient taxable temporary differences, the probability of having taxable profits before the unused tax losses or credits expire, whether the unused tax losses result from identifiable causes unlikely to recur, and the availability of tax planning opportunities (IAS 12, paragraph 36).\\n\\n3. **Tax Planning Opportunities**:\\n   - Actions that the entity would take to create or increase taxable income in a particular period before the expiry of a tax loss or tax credit carryforward (IAS 12, paragraph 30).\\n\\n4. **Recognition of Benefit**:\\n   - The benefit relating to a tax loss that can be carried back to recover current tax of a previous period should be recognized as an asset (IAS 12, paragraph 13).\\n\\n5. **Measurement and Disclosure**:\\n   - Deferred tax assets and liabilities should be measured at the tax rates expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled (IAS 12, paragraph 47).\\n   - The entity must disclose the amount of the deferred tax asset and the nature of the evidence supporting its recognition when there is a history of recent losses (IAS 12, paragraph 35).\\n   - Disclosure of the amount and expiry date of deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognized is required (IAS 12, paragraph 81(g)).\\n   - The nature of the evidence supporting the recognition of deferred tax assets should be disclosed when the utilization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable profits exceeding the profits arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences (IAS 12, paragraph 82).\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, tax losses are accounted for accurately and in compliance with IFRS standards.\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n- IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\" paragraphs 13, 30, 34, 35, 36, 47, 81(g), and 82.', 'metadata': []}, 'intermediate_steps': []}\u001b[0m\n",

       "\n",
       "### Step-by-Step Accounting for Gains on Sales of Fixed Assets:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Determine the Carrying Amount:**\n",
       "   - The carrying amount of the fixed asset is its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses (IAS 16.6).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Calculate the Gain:**\n",
       "   - The gain on the sale of a fixed asset is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the time of sale (IAS 16.71).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Recognize the Gain:**\n",
       "   - The gain should be recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized (IAS 16.68). Derecognition occurs when the asset is disposed of or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal (IAS 16.67).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Presentation in Financial Statements:**\n",
       "   - Gains on the sale of fixed assets should be presented in the income statement as part of other income or separately if material (IAS 1.97).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example Journal Entry:\n",
       "Assume a fixed asset with a carrying amount of $50,000 is sold for $70,000.\n",
